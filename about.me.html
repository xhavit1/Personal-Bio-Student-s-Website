	<h2><strong>Hi</strong>, here i will talk about myself.</h2>
	<p>I am<strong><em> Xhavit Islami</em></strong>, born in <strong>Prishtina</strong> and raised in <strong>Ferizaj.</strong>
			Firstly a thing to mention about me is that i love coding!
			As i told that i love <em>coding</em> you may guess the reason why i have chosen to study <em>Computer-Sciences</em>. <br>Since i started understanding what coding does, i became more and more corious about that. <br>But what is most important is that i, one day wanted to be the creator of the things i saw in internet.So i started trying to code on my own, tried but not that much, because i knew i'd start going to <em>University.</em> My purpose is to achieve my goal, which is even if i don't get nothing in return, i have a good feeling because i made it, i made it to the bottom and now i start thinking about the time i knew nothing about coding!
			So i hope me and everyoone else get what they work for!
			<br>
			But now i want to talk about what i do.
			I study mostly, and sometimes i give myself free-time to go out with friends or someone else and relax my mind. To be honest hinked to start practicing, to be a practicant on any workplace possible, to spend time on doing something beneficial for my coding skills.<br> Now im learning basic coding languages like: HTML<a href="abilities.html"><strong> More...</strong></p></a>
			<h3>Below i created a list with things that i like to do.</h3>
				<ul>
				<P><h1>Things i like to do :</h1></P>

				<li>Taking Photos</li>
				<li>Hiking</li>
				<li>Watch Movies; My 3 favourite movies are these:</li>

			<p>But besides them i like many many other things, for example i love Sunsets and Sunrises, and i decided to make a <a href="photo.gallery.html"> <Strong>Photo Gallery</a></strong> with them and some other photos. Some photos are taken while i was skiing at  <em><strong>Brezovica skii center.</strong></em><br><em> I love</em><strong> Winter time.</strong> Since i was a child me and my family regulary went to Brezovica every week-end, so it is impossible for me not to love winter.
